Hello,
My name is Bryan and I live in Long Beach, CA. I was born and raised in Long Beach and do not plan on leaving any time soon. I come from a big family, I have four siblings (all girls). I graduated from University of California, Irvine in 2013 with a degree in Mathematics. After a year working in the industry as a test engineer I decided I wanted to work towards becoming a software engineer. That is when I found Oregon State's Online Post Bacc Computer Science program. This is my fourth quarter being apart of the program. I can't believe it is already coming up on a year since I started, it is amazing how time flies. I enjoy all sports, but my favorite sport is golf. I am also a big fan of music. I currently really like listening to the vocal trance group Above & Beyond and the indie rock artist James Bay.
